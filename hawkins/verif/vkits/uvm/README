213686 uvm: have the reg map print its full name on an error, so we know where to debug.

195649 fix for 1_1d for uvm_reg::XatomicX function see http://osqa.caveonetworks.com/questions/523/uvm_reg-xatomicx-function-is-broken-in-uvm-11d-and-probably-12

190105 1_2 with Cavium changes from r146137 (1_1d)

152780 Synopsys' sparse register model

125777 Fixed endif comment to make Eclipse/DVT happy

125424 1_1c has changes that correlate with those in 1_1b @124394.

125203 A clean uvm 1_1c src.

Since we are aparently not capable of keeping this area in a relatively clean
svn state, this readme file will serve as a log of which commits actually
provide content change.

Hopefully this will be useful when we migrate to the next version of UVM so
that it is easy to apply all the necessary patches.

124394  Temporary fix to stop putting NO_REG_HW_RESET_TEST entries into the
        resource db per uvm_reg_field

124095  Fixed potential issue in uvm_re_match which isn't in 1_1c, we probably
        won't hit it as the code only comes into play when not using DPI for
        regexp matching

123683  Performance tune the reg's change, don't make local variables unless
        needed for an error printout

123574  Reapply John's prior fixes at 117393 and 117477 that were missed

123300  Added full_name to TLM port "too few connections" error

121460  Remove all direct calls to area_utils from the o78 tree

121370  Change dpi to svn ignore obj directory, and add Makefile previously
        added ...

121316  This is a summary commit of all the changes we have made to the uvm
        source ...

121313  This is a clean uvm 1_1b src and uvm.flist
